# BRISQUE
This is the blind image quality assessment program I am looking at. Looking at this study: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/publications/2012/TIP%20BRISQUE.pdf, it seems that BRISQUE is competetive with other similar algorithms. 

See the readme.txt file in this repository for more information about implementing the program
